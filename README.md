Steps on how to create a Github page: (using HTML and CSS)

    Step 1: Create the layout of your page. Think of all the elements that you need or want in your page and put them in your drafted layout.

    Step 2: Start creating your HTML first without all the CSS. It is important to first group and arrange all your page's elements before you start adding designs and visuals.

    Step 3: After you have created your HTML, add the necessary classes and tags that you would use in order to group up your page's elements. I really recommend looking up different examples in the internet since it helps give you ideas.

    Step 4: Upload your HTML and CSS files to github. 

    Step 5: Activate the page by going to your Github's settings and configuring the Pages tab. This will generate a link that would lead to your Github page.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?: 

    One of the many takeaways that I got from this exercise is that CSS is a strong tool that allows their users to create websites based on their imagination. I am not much of a designer so my website is not that good, but looking through a lot projects that are made using CSS, I saw that CSS's strength really depends on how create the user can be.
